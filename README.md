### Objective:
The objective is to understand the underlying structure in your dataset and come up with a suitable forecasting model which can effectively forecast USD/INR exchange rate for next 30 days. This forecast model will be used by exporting and importing companies to understand the currency movements and accordingly set their revenue expectations.


### Data Used:


 1973 to 2021(USD/INR)
